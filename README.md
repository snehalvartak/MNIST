# MNIST Classification using Deep Neural Network

Here I have trained a fully connected net for MNIST Classification using Tensorflow
This fully connected network has 5 hidden layers with 1024 hidden units each.
To initialize the weights I have used Xavier initialization technique taught in class.
This initialization coupled with batch normalization and Adam Optimizer gives an accuracy of 98.3% on test data.
